# Authentication VS Authorisation
Authentication and Authorization are the key components of **secure data access control** 👨‍💻🔐

📍**Authentication** means verifying someone's identity - usually through credentials like a username and password. It's like checking employees IDs to enter the company.

📍**Authorization** happens after authentication and determines what that employee has access to, like allowing only the managers to access all floors while interns may only have access to the ground floor.

📍**Authentication** verifies WHO you are, while authorization decides WHAT you can do. You authenticate your identity when logging into LinkedIn, and then LinkedIn authorizes what information you can view based on your account type.

Knowing how these security mechanisms work allows you to build more secure systems and properly control access.
