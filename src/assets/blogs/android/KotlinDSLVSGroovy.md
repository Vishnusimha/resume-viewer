# Kotlin DSL VS Groovy

In android development, both Kotlin DSL (Domain Specific Language) and Groovy have been used for writing the build
scripts in the Gradle build system. But they offer different features and capabilities: 🚀👨‍💻

💡Before we start (Domain Specific Language) mean: is a specialized language optimized for a specific task or domain.

1. Type Safety:
    - Kotlin DSL : Better compile-time error checking by providing a more structured, statically-typed syntax. Which can
      catch mistakes before they cause runtime errors.
    - Groovy: Concise because it dynamically-typed. But can lead to runtime errors.

2. Performance
    - Kotlin DSL: Slightly slower to start especially during the first run. But with improvements in gradle will
      catching up
      in speed.
    - Groovy: Historically it faster to start.

3. Popularity:

    - Kotlin DSL: Becoming more popular, many are moving to it for consistency.
    - Groovy: Used in older projects. Might need migration efforts when you need to migrate into kotlin DSL.

4. Android IDE Support:

    - Kotlin DSL: Android Studio understands it really well, helping you write scripts with fewer mistakes.
    - Groovy: Support is good but not as precise.

Which one to use:

- Use Kotlin DSL if you're already familiar with Kotlin, want better safety, and prefer Android Studio.
- Use Groovy if you're working on an older project or prefer a simpler, faster start.

💡Keep this in your mind, the choice depends on your team's expertise and project needs.
